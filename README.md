# Code Review Checklists

I am a big advocate of code reviews. I strongly encourage every team to adopt code reviews before merging each one's contribution into the codebase. 
Code reviews don't take long (usually less then 15 minutes) and have so many benefits:

* encourage developers to learn from each other
* help people writing better code
* disseminate best practices
* make the code consistent and easier to maintain

These are the checklists I use for code reviews when working on Force.com projects. Enjoy!
