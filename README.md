# Force.com Code Review Checklists

I am a big advocate of code reviews. I strongly encourage every team to adopt code reviews before merging each one's contribution into the codebase. Code reviews don't take long and have many benefits:


* they make developers learn from each other
* they encourage people to write better code
* they help disseminating best practices
* they help keeping the code internally consistent and easier to maintain

These are the checklists I use for code reviews when working on Force.com projects. Enjoy!

## Tips for developers

- Keep your code simple. Do not overcomplicate problems.
- Keep your code easy to read for humans.
- Avoid everything that is not necessary: every line of code that is not needed is a potential bug.
- Accept you will make mistakes.
- You are not your code, don't take things personally.

## Tips for reviewers

- Code reviews should last no more than 15 minutes.
- Try to review no more than 400 lines of code at a time.
- Ask questions rather than making statements.
- Avoid asking "Why did you do X?". Ask instead "Have you considered Y?"
- Treat people who know less than you with respect and patience.
- Remember to praise.
- Remember that there is often more than one way to approach a solution.
