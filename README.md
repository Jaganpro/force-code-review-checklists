# Code Review Checklists

I am a big advocate of code reviews. I strongly encourage every team to adopt code reviews before merging each one's contribution into the codebase.Code reviews don't take long and have many benefits:


* they encourage developers to learn from each other
* they make people write better code
* they help disseminating best practices
* they make the code consistent and easier to maintain

These are the checklists I use for code reviews when working on Force.com projects. Enjoy!

## Tips for developers

- Keep your code simple. Do not overcomplicate problems.
- Keep your code easy to read for humans.
- Avoid everything that is not necessary: every line of code that is not needed is a potential bug.
- Accept you will make mistakes.
- You are not your code, don't take things personally.

## Tips for reviewers

- Code reviews should last no more than 15 minutes.
- Don't review more than 400 lines of code at a time.
- Be kind to the coder, not to the code.
- Treat people who know less than you with respect and patience.
- Ask questions rather than making statements.
- Avoid the "Why?" question.
- Remember to praise.
- Remember that there is often more than one way to approach a solution.
